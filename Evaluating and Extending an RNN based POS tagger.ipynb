    "## Pipeline design\n",
    "First of all, I chose the Entropycross loss function and AdamW optimizer，because the Entropycross loss function will include the softmax function itself based on the Pytorch documentation, I won't need to write softmax function inside my training class model, which simplifies my code. Furthermore, it can speed up the model's rate of convergence. As for AdamW, it's a modified version of Adam algorithm which will accelerate the training process.\n",
    "Secondly, I imported the Dataset and Dataloader module to create my data collecting class which used pyconll module to parse the conllu corpus, then loaded the dataset into the dataloader which equals batch_iterator function, in this case, batch_iterator function is not needed in my code. One thing to mention is that I created a my_collate function for dataloader to make sure my dataloader can accept different lengths of sentences in one batch, but later, I found out that this way is a little redundant, so I just treated pad_and_encode as my collate function. After this, I trained my model and got test accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance among 11 different languages\n",
    "I loaded the 11 different languages, trained them with the initial LSTM model, and visualized their performance results in the end. Based on the bar chart, Arabic, Spanish, Japanese, and Hindi performed over 90%, among them, Spanish got the best result reaching almost 94%; Hebrew, Chinese, English, Greek, Swedish's performances linger from 85-90%, which is normal; Hungarian and Korean are below 80%, thereinto, Korean got the worst result down to 70%. As per the results, Initially, I investigated the training data size for every language, then I noticed that Spanish, Hindi have more than 13,000 train sentences, maybe it contributed to improving the test accuracy. The English, Hebrew, and Swedish only have about 4,000 to 5,000 train sentences, if we enhanced the train data size, it may improve the accuracy. For Hungarian, the train data size is only 908, so that's why the accuracy is a little low and the model is overfitting; however, for Korean, it acquired the lowest accuracy with more than 10,000 train sentences, I guess the reason for this is that Korean has a unique morphology and more morphological than western languages if we use some specific Korean tag sets, it maybe performs better. I think the same rule applies for Chinese, Greek, Arabic, and Hindi and they are just more suitable for UD tag sets than Korean. One last interesting thing is that Japanese reached a nice result with only 7025 train sentences, then I checked the token(vocabulary) size for it, it unexpectedly goes to 20,177 which far bigger than most of the chosen languages, it as well means although Japanese corpus is not very large, tokens are more various than other languages, so the model got the better generality.\n",
    "All in all, I think if we want to evaluate the model performance, we need to take train data size, train data token size, and the language's morphology into consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The relation between model complexity and accuracy\n",
    "Based on the plot in the end, if I enhance the word embedding and LSTM hidden dimension, all languages acquired higher accuracy except the Hindi language, in this case, enhancing model complexity properly can improve the test accuracy. In my case, Hindi doesn't need higher dimensions, otherwise, it would be more overfitting with a more complex model. Furthermore, I think I need a more complex model for morphologically various languages like Korean, Chinese, Greek, and Arabic. Generally speaking, at first, the complexity increases, and accuracy increases. At a certain point, the model will become too complex and tend to overfit the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Network accuracy baseline.\n",
    "Given the experience that I created classifiers in two previous machine learning assignments and the fact we used the LSTM neural and advanced AdamW algorithm, I set my baseline accuracy to 90%. After exploring all languages' corpus, only 4 languages outperformed my baseline, so for those not reaching my baseline, I may need to enhance model complexity for Greek and Chinese corpus, enrich the corpus of Hungarian, English, and Swedish, and apply specific Korean tag sets for Korean.\n",
    "\n",
    "## LSTM,GRU,Bi-directional LSTM performances analysis\n",
    "As we see in the bar charts, GRU is 0.7% higher than LSTM. For LSTM and GRU, since GRU parameters are less(only has two gates) and the convergence speed is faster, the actual time is much less, which can greatly speed up our iterative process. In terms of performance, there is no conclusive conclusion about which one is better and almost no difference and my result verified this; Bi-directional LSTM is 3% higher than LSTM. Bidirectional will go through inputs from two directions, one from past to future and one from future to past to preserve information from both past and future. It will comprehend the context better because employing the content from the future could be easier for the neural network to predict. Last but not least, bidirectional LSTM seems to perform the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regularization performance analysis\n",
    "As we can infer from the barplot, the accuracy will rise by 1.5% and 1.8% after using dropout and weight decay along with lowering train dataset accuracy, which fully proved that these two regularizations solved the model overfitting issue. For dropout, I added it to the fully-connected layer instead of the LSTM layer, because I checked some paper that said the LSTM RNN layer may amplify the noise, if we add it to the LSTM layer, it may lower the accuracy, but we can add it to the fully-connected layer, which will help improve the model generality; For weight decay, I think it would be better off starting with a low value, in my case, I used 0.0001, and adjust it as per the test accuracy performance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Augmentation performance analysis\n",
    "In this part, I chose the back translation to enrich my train corpus, and the test accuracy improved by 0.9%, which verified that this method can enhance the model's generality. In my case, I just chose the first 3 batches(about 5% of the whole train dataset to implement, so next maybe I can choose more like 10% of the whole dataset to investigate the performance, but the rule of thumb is that the augmented dataset shouldn't overwhelm the original dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extension 7-Shortcomings of the current model and how to improve it concerning a recent POS tagging paper \n",
    "As I mentioned before, the LSTM RNN layer will amplify the noise and it has more parameters that will lead to model overfitting. Most importantly, Although LSTM can handle longer sequences than RNN, the only 100-magnitude sequence at most(I found this from one paper). All of the languages I chose have sentences longer than 100, so the LSTM model cannot learn features from very long sequences. Another point is that each cell of LSTM encloses 4 fully connected layers (MLP). If the time span of LSTM is large and the network is deep, this calculation will be very large and time-consuming.\n",
    "Based on the recent POS tagging paper, we can bring in an Adversarial training regularization method to improve the tagging accuracy. The basic theory is to train neural networks on how to spot intentionally misleading data or behaviors. At each training loop, we\n",
    "create adversarial examples against the current model, and train on the mixture of positive data and adversarial data to achieve robustness to input perturbations. Adversarial training not only improves the overall tagging accuracy but also avoids over-fitting well in low resource languages and boosts tagging accuracy for rarely unobservable words.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extension 8 analysis-Japanese test dataset performance using UD's universal vs Japanese specific tag sets.\n",
    "When I used the Japanese specific tag sets to train the model, the test dataset accuracy rose by 1% compared with universal tag sets. Because the specific tag sets can tag tokens in a more detailed and accurate way, this leads to higher model generality. However, this is not 100% sure, if the specific language tag sets have much more categories than universal's, it may be more difficult for the model to predict, then lower the test accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General educational  summary\n",
    "I think PyTorch is a very powerful module to implement machine learning, and we can use LSTM, GRU neural networks to train the model. If the model doesn't perform very well, we can use the built-in regularization method to solve the overfitting issue, which is very convenient. Moreover, we can use dataloader and dataset module to load the data in a very efficient way.\n",
    "When I tried to refactor the model, it took me a large amount of time to make it work, so it's a little tricky to include forward and neural network training inside one Class. Also, loading 11 languages and training each of them is super time-consuming, besides these, I also explored different word embedding and hidden state dimensions, which as well spent a lot of time. But one thing is that if I pushed the training process to the GPU, it will be much faster than the CPU.\n",
    "From my perspective, I feel that the padding and encoding part is a little complex, so I just put the modified pad_and_encode function in the dataloader, which both saves time and simplifies my code. Another thought is that maybe we can one-hot encoding which is easier."
